Sharing this post on [Morgan Stanley and AI](https://openai.com/index/morgan-stanley/) from the OpenAI blog.

> "This technology makes you as smart as the smartest person in the organization. Each client is different, and AI helps us cater to each client's unique needs."
> Jeff McMillan, Head of Firmwide AI at Morgan Stanley

## Evals

> To evaluate GPT-4's performance against their experts, Morgan Stanley ran summarization evals to test how effectively the model condensed vast amounts of intellectual capital and process-driven content into concise summaries. Advisors and prompt engineers graded AI responses for accuracy and coherence, allowing the team to refine prompts and improve output quality.

The biggest takeaway

> The eval framework wasn't static; it evolved as the team learned.

This should be expected with Generative AI, your eval framework should not be static, and your project is never _done_.

## Expanding the corpus

This is massive and extremely well done

> "We went from being able to answer 7,000 questions to a place where we can now effectively answer any question from a corpus of 100,000 documents," says David Wu, Head of Firmwide AI Product & Architecture Strategy at Morgan Stanley.

## Adoption

> over 98% adoption in wealth management

!! !! !!

> Their strong eval framework has also unlocked a flywheel for future solutions and services.

I am currently reading [The Value Flywheel Effect](https://itrevolution.com/product/the-value-flywheel-effect/) so this really resonated with me.

They've tackled the two hardest obstacles, in my opinion, they've created a very successful project AND gotten widespread adoption. When stakeholders are bought in like this, releasing additional projects should have a much lower barrier to entry.
