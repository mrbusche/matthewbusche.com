If you'd like to hide the open editors tab in VS Code, especially useful if you're trying to open multiple files in a folder at once and it keeps pushing the list down, you can open up settings `Ctrl + ,` and search for `openeditors` and set the number of editors shown in the open editors pane to 0.
