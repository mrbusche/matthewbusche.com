I really enjoyed [this podcast with Nikesh Arora, CEO of Palo Alto Networks](https://hbr.org/podcast/2024/11/future-of-business-palo-alto-networks-nikesh-arora-on-managing-risk-in-the-age-of-ai), where he discussed how much of their strategy is tied to acquisition vs trying to build everything themselves in house. He had some other insights, that probably aren't revolutionary, but I appreciated his openness in this interview.

Here are my key takeaways:

## The AI Revolution and Cybersecurity

- With practically everything being internet connected, the potential points of vulnerability for cyberattacks are enormous
- Bad actors are increasingly using AI to infiltrate systems, which requires companies Palo Alto Networks use AI to counter their attacks
- He sees AI as a productivity tool that will augment human work, taking over repetitive tasks and allowing employees to focus on more enjoyable tasks

## Acquisition and Integration

- Palo Alto is acquiring innovative cybersecurity companies to stay ahead of threats
- He stresses the importance of empowering the acquired teams and providing them with resources

## Concerns and Risks

- He discusses the importance of a zero trust security model, treating every user and device with the same level of scrutiny
- They talk about the (obvious) potential for GenAI to be used maliciously
- Arora anticipates regulations focusing on transparency, guardrails, and control of critical processes
- He strongly emphasizes the importance of collaboration between industry and regulators.
