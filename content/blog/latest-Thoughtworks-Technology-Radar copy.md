The latest Thoughtworks Technology Radar is out. Here are a few blips that caught my eye:

- Function calling with LLMs - Integrate LLMs with external functions, APIs, or tools and allow them to act on their outputs
- Dynamic few-shot prompting - Dynamically include specific examples to guide the model
- Langfuse - Observability for LLMs
- Bruno - Open-source alternative to Postman
- ColPali - Leverages Vision Language Models to take a holistic approach for understanding text and visual content
- Instructor - Helping LLMs generate structured output effectively
- DeepEval - LLM evaluation framework but also offers some "red team" features
