I'm excited to announce I will be speaking at [Iowa Code Camp](https://iowacodecamp.com/session/list#37) on December 5th in Ankeny, Iowa on Responsible Responsive Web Design.

I'll be discussing how you can design a website responsibly and delivery a consistent user experience to users on small and large screen devices. I'll also talk about how to decrease your website's page size quickly and effectively to make your website load fast even on the slowest of connections. We'll also cover using the newest HTML specifications even on browsers that do not have native support.
