[Software Engineering at Google](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/software-engineering-at/9781492082781/)

- Programming is certainly a significant part of software engineering: after all, programming is how you generate new software in the first place. If you accept this distinction, it also becomes clear that we might need to delineate between programming tasks (development) and software engineering tasks (development, modification, maintenance).

- distinction is at the core of what we call sustainability for software. Your project is sustainable if, for the expected life span of your software, you are capable of reacting to whatever valuable change comes along, for either technical or business reasons.
- Importantly, we are looking only for capability-you might choose not to perform a given upgrade, either for lack of value or other priorities.Â² When you are fundamentally incapable of reacting to a change in underlying technology or product direction, you're placing a high-risk bet on the hope that such a change never becomes critical

- Team organization, project composition, and the policies and practices of a software project all dominate this aspect of software engineering complexity. These problems are inherent to scale: as the organization grows and its projects expand, does it become more efficient at producing software?

- 2012, we tried to put a stop to this with rules mitigating churn: infrastructure teams must do the work to move their internal users to new versions themselves or do the update in place, in backward-compatible fashion. This policy, which we've called the "Churn Rule," scales better: dependent projects are no longer spending progressively greater effort just to keep up. We've also learned that having a dedicated group of experts execute the change scales better than asking for more maintenance effort from every user: experts spend some time learning the whole problem in depth and then apply that expertise to every subproblem. Forcing users to respond to churn means that every affected team does a worse job ramping up, solves their immediate problem, and then throws away that now useless knowledge. Expertise scales better.

- The more frequently you change your infrastructure, the easier it becomes to do so.

- We have found that most of the time, when code is updated as part of something like a compiler upgrade, it becomes less brittle and easier to upgrade in the future. In an ecosystem in which most code has gone through several upgrades, it stops depending on the nuances of the underlying implementation; instead, it depends on the actual abstraction guaranteed by the language or OS. Regardless of what exactly you are upgrading, expect the first upgrade for a codebase to be significantly more expensive than later upgrades, even controlling for other factors.

- We believe strongly in data informing decisions, but we recognize that the data will change over time, and new data may present itself. This means, inherently, that decisions will need to be revisited from time to time over the life span of the system in question. For long-lived projects, it's often critical to have the ability to change directions after an initial decision is made. And, importantly, it means that the deciders need to have the right to admit mistakes. Contrary to some people's instincts, leaders who admit mistakes are more respected, not less.

- Programming is the immediate act of producing code. Software engineering is the set of policies, practices, and tools that are necessary to make that code useful for as long as it needs to be used and allowing collaboration across a team.

- Software engineering" differs from "programming" in dimensionality: programming is about producing code. Software engineering extends that to include the maintenance of that code for its useful life span

- Software is sustainable when, for the expected life span of the code, we are capable of responding to changes in dependencies, technology, or product requirements. We may choose to not change things, but we need to be capable.

- Being data driven is a good start, but in reality, most decisions are based on a mix of data, assumption, precedent, and argument. It's best when objective data makes up the majority of those inputs, but it can rarely be all of them.

- Software development is a team endeavor. And to succeed on an engineering team-or in any other creative collaboration-you need to reorganize your behaviors around the core principles of humility, respect, and trust.

- It turns out that this Genius Myth is just another manifestation of our insecurity.

- Many programmers are afraid to share work they've only just started because it means peers will see their mistakes and know the author of the code is not a genius.

- The current DevOps philosophy toward tech productivity is explicit about these sorts of goals: get feedback as early as possible, test as early as possible and think about security and production environments as early as possible. This is all bundled into the idea of "shifting left" in the developer workflow; the earlier we find a problem, the cheaper it is to fix it.

- A good postmortem should include the following:

1. A brief summary of the event
2. A timeline of the event, from discovery through investigation to resolution
3. The primary cause of the event
4. Impact and damage assessment
5. A set of action items (with owners) to fix the problem immediately
6. A set of action items to prevent the event from happening again
7. Lessons learned

- Admitting that you've made a mistake or you're simply out of your league can increase your status over the long run. In fact, the willingness to express vulnerability is an outward show of humility, it demonstrates accountability and the willingness to take responsibility, and it's a signal that you trust others' opinions. In return, people end up respecting your honesty and strength. Sometimes, the best thing you can do is just say, "I don't know"
