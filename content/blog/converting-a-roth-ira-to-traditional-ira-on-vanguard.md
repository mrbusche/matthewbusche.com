I mistakenly put money into my Traditional IRA at Vanguard this year instead of my Roth IRA. I couldn't for the life me find directions on how to change this, so I called Vanguard. It's actually very simple.

1. Login to your account
2. Click on FORMS in the header
3. Click Add or remove money, trade within your account
4. Click Remove excess distributions or contributions, convert from a traditional to a Roth IRA, or recharacterize contributions
   Click Remove excess contributions, convert assets, or recharacterize contributions
5. Fill out the rest of form

<i>Disclaimer: I'm not a tax professional, just a dude who messed up his contributions.</i>
