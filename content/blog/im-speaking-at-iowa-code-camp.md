I'm happy to announce I've been selected to speak at [Iowa Code Camp](https://iowacodecamp.com/), May 9, 2015 at [The Hotel Kirkwood](https://www.thehotelatkirkwood.com/) in Cedar Rapids. If you're interested in attending the cost is absolutely free for anyone wanting to attend and registration will be open shortly. I'll have a follow up post once registration is open.

I will be speaking about [Responsible Responsive Web Design](https://iowacodecamp.com/session/list#9). In the 75 minute talk I'll be covering what responsive design is and how to build a website using it. I'll also cover how to design a responsive website responsibly &#8211; How you can delivery a consistent user experience to users on small and large screen devices and how to decrease your website's page size quickly and effectively to make your website load fast even on slow internet connections. Lastly, I'll cover how to use the newest HTML5 specifications even on browsers that do not have native support.

A big thanks goes out to [Scott Jehl](https://scottjehl.com/), who wrote the book [Responsible Responsive Design](https://abookapart.com/products/responsible-responsive-design) that inspired this talk.
