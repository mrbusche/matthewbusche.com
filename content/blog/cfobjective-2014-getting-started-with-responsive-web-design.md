I tweeted this out a while back, but I have been selected to speak at cfObjective() 2014! I [blogged in early November about my proposal](https://mrbusche.com/2013/11/03/cfobjective-proposal-getting-started-with-responsive-web-design/) and the people have spoken! I hope to see all of you at the conference!
