My personal notes from [The Lean Startup](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004J4XGN6/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1) by Eric Ries

- Identify where you've made assumptions instead of using facts. Make your assumptions facts by getting customer feedback
- Early adopters are suspicious of something with too much polish.
  - If it's ready for everyone to adopt how much advantage can they get?
  - Additional features or polish added is a waste
- When in doubt simplify.
- Any additional work beyond what was required to get feedback is a waste
- Customers don't care how much time something takes to build they care that it solves their needs
- Everyone thinks their recent innovation is why the numbers went up. It's everyone else's fault when numbers go down.
- Toyota [Andon Cord](https://itrevolution.com/kata/)
  - Defective change is removed immediately and automatically
  - Everyone on the relevant team is notified of the problem
  - Team is blocked from introducing any new changes
  - Root cause analysis performed
- Dealerships sometimes have just in case inventory which cost a lot of money to keep stock on hand that we never be needed switch to just-in-time inventory and only have a one what you need
- Use 5 why's? to answer questions
  - &#8220;We didn't do x&#8221;, &#8220;Why didn't you do x?&#8221;
  - &#8220;We didn't do x because of y&#8221;, &#8220;Why didn't you do y?&#8221;
- LTSE [long term stock exchange](https://ltse.com/)
