I'm happy to announce I'll be speaking at [Prairie.Code()](https://prairiecode.amegala.com/) on September 13, 2019! The conference will be held at the Holiday Inn Conference Center near the Des Moines airport.

I'll be speaking on Secure by Design and how you can ensure security throughout development of your application. I'll cover some of the OWASP top 10, best practices, and things my team has implemented at work. I've given a version of this talk at [Iowa Technology Summit](https://www.technologyiowa.org/), [DevOpsDays Des Moines](https://devopsdays.org/events/2018-des-moines/welcome/), and [Connectaha](https://connectaha.com/), but this will be the best version yet.

[Registration](https://prairiecode.amegala.com/Registration/Pricing) is open now, so don't delay in getting your tickets. Once they're gone, they're gone!
