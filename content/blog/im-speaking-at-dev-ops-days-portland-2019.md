I'm happy to announce I'll be speaking at [DevOpsDays Portland](https://devopsdays.org/events/2019-portland/welcome/) on September 12, 2019! The conference will be held at the Oregon Convention Center.

I'll be giving a lightning talk on how you can quickly assess web performance in an application. I gave a [similar version](https://youtu.be/Xg6FAU7s61g) at [DevOpsDays Des Moines](https://www.devopsdays.org/events/2019-des-moines/welcome/), but this will be an improved version with actual working charts, lol

[Registration](https://devopsdayspdx2019.busyconf.com/bookings/new) is open now, so don't delay in getting your tickets!
