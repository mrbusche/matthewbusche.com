This [interview with Cohere CEO Aidan Gomez](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XRpTZpHjfc) is a must watch (or listen) for anyone interested in AI. Here are some key takeaways:

- The role of "luck and chance" in his journey.
- The smallest nuance can significantly impact language model outputs, highlighting the need for robust and reliable models (Cohere is trying to build models with this in mind).
- Tailoring AI solutions to specific needs, like generating medically relevant summaries for a doctor based on a simple phrase like "My knee hurts." vs requiring them to look through 20 years of patient notes.
- Listening to customers is crucial for identifying valuable applications. We are not even close to having all the answers with LLMs.
- Begin with the most cost-effective solutions and gradually build complexity. You shouldn't be starting from scratch is most use cases.
- Waiting 6-12 months can dramatically reduce development costs (specifically referring to building an LLM). Staying on the bleeding edge may be profitable but waiting 6-12 months and taking advantage of everything learned is more profitable.
