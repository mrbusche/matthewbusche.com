I'm happy to announce I'll be speaking at [MidwestJS](http://midwestjs.com/) on August 7-9, 2019! The conference will be held at Schulze Hall at the University of St Thomas in beautiful downtown Minneapolis.

I'll be speaking on two topics - Secure by Design and how you can ensure security throughout development of your application. I'll cover some of the OWASP top 10, best practices, and things my team has implemented at work. I'll also be giving a new full length talk on "Web Performance - Where do I start?" where you can learn about quick hit ways to improve your website performance.

[Registration](https://ti.to/midwestjs/midwest-js-2019) is open now, so don't delay in getting your tickets!
