Like a lot of Seth Godin posts, this one is short but impactful, [Severe Weather Alert](https://seths.blog/2024/11/severe-weather-alert/)

He discusses getting an alert every day about severe weather in his area, but now it's just "weather"

> We think that regularly alerting people to something is likely to get their attention again and again.

The more an application cries wolf, the more likely we are to ignore it
