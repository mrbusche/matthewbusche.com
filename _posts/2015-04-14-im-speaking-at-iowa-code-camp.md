I&#8217;m happy to announce I&#8217;ve been selected to speak at [Iowa Code Camp](http://iowacodecamp.com/), May 9, 2015 at [The Hotel Kirkwood](http://www.thehotelatkirkwood.com/) in Cedar Rapids. If you&#8217;re interested in attending the cost is absolutely free for anyone wanting to attend and registration will be open shortly. I&#8217;ll have a follow up post once registration is open.

I will be speaking about [Responsible Responsive Web Design](http://iowacodecamp.com/session/list#9). In the 75 minute talk I&#8217;ll be covering what responsive design is and how to build a website using it. I&#8217;ll also cover how to design a responsive website responsibly &#8211; How you can delivery a consistent user experience to users on small and large screen devices and how to decrease your website&#8217;s page size quickly and effectively to make your website load fast even on slow internet connections. Lastly, I&#8217;ll cover how to use the newest HTML5 specifications even on browsers that do not have native support.

A big thanks goes out to [Scott Jehl](http://scottjehl.com/), who wrote the book [Responsible Responsive Design](http://abookapart.com/products/responsible-responsive-design) that inspired this talk.
