Unhobbling an LLM refers to the process of removing limitations or constraints that prevent the LLM from reaching its full potential.

Imagine a really talented artist being forced to only use crayons. They could still draw some cool stuff, but imagine what they could do with paints and brushes or pencils.

The reasons for the hobbling are well intentioned. It's kind of like keeping a powerful dog on a leash - you want to make sure things stay safe and under control.
