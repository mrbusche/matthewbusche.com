I'm happy to announce I've been selected to speak at <a href="https://devobjective.com" target="_blank">dev.Objective() 2016</a>! I will speaking on &#8220;Delivering Responsibly&#8221;.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Session Description</span>

I'll cover how to deliver fast, flexible and accessible websites. How you can deliver a consistent user experience to all users whether they're on a small screen device or a 4k monitor. Whether they have a 2G connection or Google Fiber.

I'll discuss some of the challenges we as developers face when trying to deliver responsibly and how to overcome some of those challenges. New specifications will make some of these challenges easier and I'll cover how you can implement some of these features in non greenfield browsers.

I will discuss how http/2 mitigates some of the challenges we face, but how it doesn't change as much as we might think when it comes to delivering responsibly.

Lastly I'll cover the new Service Worker Specification and what it brings to the table.
