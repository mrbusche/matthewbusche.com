My personal notes fromÂ [The Lean Startup](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004J4XGN6/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1) by Eric Ries

  * Identify where you&#8217;ve made assumptions instead of using facts. Make your assumptions facts by getting customer feedback
  * Early adopters are suspicious of something with too much polish. 
      * If it&#8217;s ready for everyone to adopt how much advantage can they get?
      * Additional features or polish added is a waste
  * When in doubt simplify.
  * Any additional work beyond what was required to get feedback is a waste
  * Customers don&#8217;t care how much time something takes to build they care that it solves their needs
  * Everyone thinks their recent innovation is why the numbers went up. It&#8217;s everyone else&#8217;s fault when numbers go down.
  * Toyota [Andon Cord](https://itrevolution.com/kata/) 
      * Defective change is removed immediately and automatically
      * Everyone on the relevant team is notified of the problem
      * Team is blocked from introducing any new changes
      * Root cause analysis performed
  * Dealerships sometimes have just in case inventory which cost a lot of money to keep stock on hand that we never be needed switch to just-in-time inventory and only have a one what you need
  * Use 5 why&#8217;s? to answer questions 
      * &#8220;We didn&#8217;t do x&#8221;, &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you do x?&#8221;
      * &#8220;We didn&#8217;t do x because of y&#8221;, &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you do y?&#8221;
  * LTSE [long term stock exchange](https://ltse.com/)
