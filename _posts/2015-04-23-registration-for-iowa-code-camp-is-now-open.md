Registration for Iowa Code Camp is now [open](https://www.iowacodecamp.com/attendee/register). The event is completely free for anyone who wants to attend and includes breakfast and lunch onsite and also an after party hosted by [Robert Half Technology](https://www.roberthalf.com/technology/).

The event is Saturday, May 9th from 8 am to 5:30 pm at the Hotel Kirkwood in Cedar Rapids. There will be 5 blocks of sessions with 7 sessions going on at a time, so you're sure to find something you want to attend during each [time slot](https://www.iowacodecamp.com/session/schedule).

There are 100, 200 and even a few 300 level sessions covering topics such as Agile methodologies, DevOps, Ember, Git, Go, Kafka, R and Responsive Web Design. If you attended Iowa Code Camp last November in Ankeny there are many speakers who presented that are presenting again this year on different topics.
