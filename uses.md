## Editor + Terminal

- Visual Studio Code for JavaScript (front end and back end) and HTML development
- IntelliJ IDEA for any Java based back end work
- Cmder is my terminal of choice, but Git Bash if I need to use curl

## Desktop Apps

- I use Google Keep for any note taking and Google Tasks for any recurring reminders
- Backup at work is done through OneDrive, at home I use Google Drive
- I use [scoop](https://github.com/ScoopInstaller/Scoop) to install apps when possible

## Hardware

- At work I have a Dell Latitude E7470
- At home I have a [Surface Laptop Studio](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/d/surface-laptop-studio/8srdf62swkpf)
- I use the [Microsoft Ergonomic Keyboard](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/d/microsoft-ergonomic-keyboard/93841ngdwr1h) and a [Logitech MX Master 3S](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/mice/mx-master-3s.html)
