## Editor + Terminal

- Visual Studio Code for JavaScript (front end and back end) and HTML development
- IntelliJ IDEA for any Java based back end work
- Cmder is my terminal of choice, but Git Bash if I need to use curl

## Desktop Apps

- I use Google Keep for any note taking and Google Tasks for any recurring reminders
- Backup at work is done through OneDrive, at home I use Google Drive

## Hardware

- At work I have a Dell Latitude with 16 GB of RAM
- At home I have a Lenovo Yoga 710
- I use the Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000 at home and work
